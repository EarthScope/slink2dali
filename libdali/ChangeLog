2008.284: 1.2
	- Change dl_write() to return an error -1 when the server 
	acknowledgement indicates there was an error.  Also print 
	the server replies indicating errors at a lower verbosity
	level than acknowledgements indicating success.

2008.256: 1.1
	- DataLink protocol addition of packet end time changes, this
	modified the WRITE command and PACKET response to include
	both the packt data start and end times. 
	
2008.196: 1.0
	- Do not fail if setsockopt() failed to set socket timeouts.

2008.193: 0.9.7
	- Modify behavior of dl_read() to consume data from a packet
	that is too large for the supplied buffer.
	- Generalize the names of the arguments to dl_splitstreamid().
	- Parse PACKETSIZE capabilities flag from server, store in
	new DLCP.maxpktsize and check size in dl_write().
	- Add documentation tagging for Doxygen to all sources.

2008.173: 0.9.6
	- Add DLCP.writeperm flag and set to true if the server
	returns the write permission flag in it's capabilities
	string.

2008.169: 0.9.5
	- Add DLCP.iotimeout parameter and set the socket timeout
	options (SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO) if they exist on the
	system, otherwise use an alarm timer to interrupt send/recv
	calls.  These measures should reset connections in bad network
	environments.  Timeout defaults to 60 seconds.

2008.078:
	- Use io.h header instead of unistd.h for Win32.

2008.075: 0.9.4
	- Replace redundant error message for unsuccessful sending of
	WRITE commands with a check for reply from server in
	dl_sendpacket().
	- Remove const qualifier from user-supplied logging functions. 
	- Fix dlp_genclientid() and defines for Win32.

2008.074: 0.9.3
	- Update dlp_genclientid() to lookup the current user without
	needing an interactive shell login.
	- Fix dl_freedlcp(), address and client ID strings are now static.

2008.072: 0.9.2
	- Implement dlp_genclientid() routine to generate client IDs.
        - Change dl_newdlcp() to take address and progname arguments,
	these strings will be copied and stored in the DLCP struct
	and freed with dl_freedlcp().  dl_newdlcp() now sets the client
	ID using dlp_genclientid().
	- Change portable define DLP_DARWIN to DLP_BSD to cover all BSDs.

2008.070: 0.9.1
	- Add an infomatch argument to dl_getinfo() and add the match
	expression to the INFO request.  Allows limiting a request for
	CONNECTIONS to specific clients.

2008.060:
	- Change dl_getinfo() to take a pointer-to-a-pointer for the
	info buffer and allocate an appropriate size buffer when
	the maxinfosize argument is 0.

2008.057: 0.9
	- Initial version, derived from libslink 2.0.
