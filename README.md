# slink2dali - a SeedLink to DataLink client

This program collects data from a SeedLink server and submits it
to a DataLink server.  Both connections are TCP/IP and, although
it is common to run the program on the same machine as one or
both servers, it can be run from any host that can connect to
both servers.

For usage information see the slink2dali(1) man page in the 'doc'
directory.

## Building/Installing

In most environments a simple 'make' will compile the program.

For further installation simply copy the resulting binary and man page
(in the 'doc' directory) to appropriate system directories.
